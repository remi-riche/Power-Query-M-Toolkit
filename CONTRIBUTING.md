# Contributing to Power-Query-M-Toolkit

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Power-Query-M-Toolkit. It's people like you that make Power-Query-M-Toolkit such a great tool.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Power-Query-M-Toolkit Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## What we are looking for

Power-Query-M-Toolkit is an open-source project that appreciates help from the community. We welcome contributions of:

- Code submissions for bug fixes or new features
- Documentation updates, enhancements, designs, or typos
- Bug reports and feature requests

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/remi-riche/Power-Query-M-Toolkit/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/remi-riche/Power-Query-M-Toolkit/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you do not see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this project, you should:

1. **Minor Contributions**: Such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted via a pull request.
   
2. **Major Contributions**: Significant changes or new features should be reported as [issues](https://github.com/remi-riche/Power-Query-M-Toolkit/issues) first. This way we can have a discussion about the suggestion before you put significant effort into it.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/remi-riche/Power-Query-M-Toolkit/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/remi-riche/Power-Query-M-Toolkit/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `code --format` for style unification
