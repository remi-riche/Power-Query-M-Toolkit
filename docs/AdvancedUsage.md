# Advanced Usage of Power-Query-M-Toolkit

This advanced guide provides insights into sophisticated techniques for leveraging the Power-Query-M-Toolkit. Go beyond the basics with combined functions, customized operations, and performance optimization tips for Power Query M.

## Combining Functions for Complex Transformations

Enhance your data transformation pipelines by chaining multiple functions together. Use the Power-Query-M-Toolkit to clean, deduplicate, and refine your data in a seamless flow:

```m
let
  Source         = YourDataSource, 
  CleanedNumbers = CleanPhoneNumber(Source), 
  DedupedData    = DeduplicateByKey(CleanedNumbers, "KeyColumn"), 
  RefinedData    = ExcludeUniformColumns(DedupedData)
in
  RefinedData
```

In this sequence, each function is applied in turn, building upon the previous step's output to produce a refined dataset.

## Customizing Functions for Specific Needs

Customize the toolkit's functions to suit your specific data scenarios. Here's an example of how you can add additional logic to an existing function:

```m
let
    OriginalFunction = (param1 as type1, param2 as type2) as returnType =>
    let
        // Insert the original function code here
    in
        OriginalResult,
    CustomFunction = (param1 as type1, param2 as type2, newParam as newType) as returnType =>
    let
        OriginalResult = OriginalFunction(param1, param2),
        // Insert custom logic here utilizing newParam
    in
        CustomResult
in
    CustomFunction
```


This structure allows you to extend the functionality while preserving the original behavior.

## Performance Optimization Techniques

Working with big datasets requires strategies to keep transformations efficient:

- **Selective Loading**: Import only necessary columns and rows to minimize memory usage.
- **Push-down Computations**: Whenever possible, leverage source system capabilities to reduce the load on Power Query.
- **Early Reduction**: Apply filters and remove duplicates early to decrease the volume of data being processed downstream.

## Error Handling in Power Query M

Robust error handling is crucial for maintaining data integrity:

```m
let
  Source             = YourDataSource, 
  SafeTransformation = try YourTransformationFunction(Source) otherwise error "Transformation failed", 
  CleanedData        = if SafeTransformation[HasError] then null else SafeTransformation[Value]
in
  CleanedData
```

This pattern captures errors, allowing for graceful degradation or alternative processing paths.

## Conclusion

With these advanced techniques, you can tackle complex data tasks within Excel and Power BI, ensuring your workflows are both efficient and robust.
